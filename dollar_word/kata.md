Enter the dollar word Kata.

From the internet:

A dollar word is one whose total value is exactly 100 when each of its letters is assigned a value according to its position in the alphabet: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26. Some examples of dollar words are: contented, cookout, mittens and shadowing.

Basically we have a few goals:

1. Take a list of words and spit each dollar word
2. Count all the dollar words in a list
3. Count total words
4. Do this using TDD
